\subsection{{\tt estuary} package }

Water supply assessment for an estuary basin can be simulated using
the {\tt estuary} package.  Estuary water supply requirements are
imposed on its inlets using minFlow constraints.  The {\tt estuary}
package is intended to be paired with a default {\tt fcAssessor} (see
Section \ref{fcAssessor}).  By default, estuary water supply
requirements are designated as an ``envTarg'' landscape.

The {\tt estuary} package uses the following procedure to assess the
water supply needs for an estuary:

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Set the water supply requirement for each inlet,
   based on their individual minFlow constraint.

 \item Reduce water supply requirement in response to capacity and
 management constraints at each inlet.

\end{enumerate}
