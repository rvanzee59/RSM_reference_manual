\subsection{{\tt s4Runoff} package }

Flood control assessment for the S4 drainage basin (near Lake
Okeechobee) can be simulated using the {\tt s4Runoff} package. 

The {\tt s4Runoff} package uses the following procedure to assess the
flood control needs in the S4 basin:

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Compute surplus flow in the WCU.  This includes inflows from
   inlet nodes and boundary conditions and outflows from unmanaged and
   water supply releases from outlet nodes.

 \item Retrieve water supply delivery computed for the outlet from
   Lake Okeechobee.

 \item Compute HPM stress from the WCU's hydrologic process module.

 \item Use surplus flow, water supply delivery and HPM stress to
   compute projected WCU storage.

 \item Compute excess volume in the WCU, defined as the portion of
   projected storage above the WCU's flood control level

 \item Set outlet flood control releases.  If the water level in Lake
   Okeechobee is below the backpump threshold, backpump to excess to
   the Lake, subject to conveyance and management constraints (release
   to Caloosahatchee basin is zero).  Otherwise, route a specified
   fraction of the excess to the Caloosahatchee basin, subject to
   conveyance and management constraints (the remaining balance is
   backpumped to the Lake, subject to conveyance and management
   constraints).

 \item Update water supply demand node.

\end{enumerate}
