\subsection{{\tt losaenv} package }\label{losaenvFC}

Flood control assessment for a Lake Okeechobee Service Area (LOSA)
basin upstream of an estuary can be simulated using the {\tt losaenv}
package. This flood control assessor is intended to be paired with a
{\tt losaenv} assessor for water supply (see Section
\ref{losaenvWS}).

The {\tt losaenv} package uses the following procedure to assess the
flood control needs in a LOSA basin:

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Compute excess volume, defined as the portion of storage
   above the WCU's fcLevel.

 \item Compute deficit volume, defined as the portion of storage below
   the WCU's maintLevel.

 \item Compute excess flow using the following terms: excess and
   deficit volumes; basin runoff (defined as the sum of the WCU
   boundary conditions flows); environmental demand release to
   downstream estuary.

 \item Route environmental and flood control releases through estuary
   outlet structure, subject to capacity and management constraints.

\end{enumerate}
