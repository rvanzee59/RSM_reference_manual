\subsection{{\tt ukiss} package }

Flood control assessment for Lake Cypress and Hatchineha in the Upper
Kissimmee Chain of Lakes can be simulated using the {\tt ukiss}
package.  Since the outlet from both these lakes is uncontrolled, the
{\tt ukiss} package includes a volume check that limits the flood
control release to the volume of water that would lower its lake level
to the downstream lake level.

The flood control needs in the {\tt ukiss} package are assessed
through the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Compute surplus flow in the WCU.  This includes inflows from
   inlet nodes and boundary conditions and outflows from unmanaged and
   water supply releases from outlet nodes.

 \item Compute HPM stress from the WCU's hydrologic process module.

 \item Use surplus flow and HPM stress to compute projected WCU
   storage.

 \item Set flood control level to the maximum outlet tailwater level.

 \item Compute excess in the WCU, defined as the volume of projected
   storage above the flood control level

 \item Set outlet flood control releases The {\tt ukiss} package
   uses the same release methods, with the same options, as the {\tt
   default} fcAssessor package.

 \item Refine outlet flood control releases The {\tt lkissQTW} package
   uses the same refine methods, with the same options, as the {\tt
   default} fcAssessor package.  

\end{enumerate}
