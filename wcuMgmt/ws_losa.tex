\subsection{{\tt losa} package }

Water supply assessments for an agricultural basin in the Lake
Okeechobee Service Area (LOSA) can be simulated using the {\tt losa}
packages.  The {\tt losa} package uses following procedures to manage
a LOSA basin for water supply:

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Set basin water supply requirement to predefined time series
  for agricultural demand and set flow for the designated demand
  outlet node.  By default, the water supply requirement is designated
  as an ``ag'' landscape.

 \item Sum basin boundary condition flows.

 \item Compute regional water supply requirement (basin demand -
   boundary flows), subject to management and conveyance constraints
   and available storage in the lake.

 \item Reduce water supply release on demand outlet node if demand
   exceeds available supply.

\end{enumerate}
