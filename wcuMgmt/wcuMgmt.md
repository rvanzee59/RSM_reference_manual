WCU assessors have default water supply and flood control methods to
assess rquirements in the water control unit and coordinate
operational responses at the respective inlets and outlets.
Alternative methods are available through ``packages'', where the
default behavior is modified to simulate the specialized management
and operational control for a particular WCU.  The default and
alternative methods for water supply and flood control assessors are
described in the following sections. The Documentation for these assessors 
are contained in this directory.
