\section{Special Purpose Assessors}\label{Chapter:specialPurposeAssessor}

Frequently an operational or management decision depends on the
outcome of a specific assessment or calculation.  The RSM addresses
this need through special purpose assessors.  These assessors range
complexity, from a simple statistic, to an operational rule, to a
fully developed hydrologic model.  At construct time, the special
purpose assessor is supplied with user defined parameters and state
variable monitors that it needs to make its assessment.  The results
of its assessment are available through an assessor monitor.

Special purpose assessors are processed right after Hydrologic Process
Modules (HPM) but before Regional Managers (see Figure
\ref{rsmFlowchart}).  Therefore, all special purpose assessors
calculations are based on beginning of time step state variables with
the exception of HPM variables.
